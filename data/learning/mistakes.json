    "whatHappened": "Needed installer fast for big project. Skipped reference checks. Hired someone based on 'good vibes.' They no-showed twice, damaged customer's wall, demanded payment upfront. Had to fire them mid-job.",
    "costFinancial": 3500,
    "costTime": 40,
    "costOpportunity": "Lost the customer's trust. They left a bad review (since removed). Almost lost $15K follow-up project.",
    "rootCause": "Desperation + no vetting process. I was so focused on 'getting it done' that I skipped basic due diligence.",
    "lessonLearned": "NEVER hire under pressure. Better to delay a project than hire the wrong person. Speed = expensive when you skip steps.",
    "systemCreated": "Contractor vetting checklist: 1) Check 3 references. 2) Start with small test project. 3) Verify insurance. 4) Check reviews on 3+ platforms. 5) Never pay more than 25% upfront.",

    "title": "Overpromised to customer - unrealistic timeline",
    "whatHappened": "Customer asked: 'Can you install by Friday?' It was Wednesday. I said yes without checking installer availability. Installer was booked. Had to delay to next week. Customer was upset.",
    "costFinancial": 0,
    "costTime": 5,
    "costOpportunity": "Damaged trust with high-value customer. They posted on local Facebook group warning others about delays.",
    "rootCause": "People-pleasing. Afraid of losing the sale, so I said yes before thinking. Didn't want to disappoint them.",
    "lessonLearned": "Under-promise, over-deliver. It's better to say 'Let me check and get back to you' than to promise and fail. Honesty > speed.",
    "systemCreated": "New response: 'Great question! Let me confirm with my install team and I'll text you within 2 hours with exact timeline.' Then check calendar, add buffer, give realistic date.",

    "whatHappened": "Saw competitor running Facebook ads. Thought 'I should do that too!' Spent $2K on ads without testing copy, images, or targeting. Got 3 leads. None converted. $667 per lead = unsustainable.",
    "costFinancial": 2000,
    "costTime": 15,
    "costOpportunity": "Could have spent that on direct outreach (which actually works for me). Lost momentum and confidence in marketing.",
    "rootCause": "Shiny object syndrome. Assumed ads work for everyone. Didn't test assumptions. Impatience - wanted instant results.",
    "lessonLearned": "Test cheap before scaling. Start with $100-200 test budget. Validate the channel works BEFORE pouring money in. Not every tactic works for every business.",
    "systemCreated": "New rule: Never spend more than $200 on a new marketing channel until I get 3+ conversions. Test small, scale what works.",
